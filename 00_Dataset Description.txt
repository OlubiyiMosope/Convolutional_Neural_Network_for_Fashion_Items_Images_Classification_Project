General Dataset Description:

- The dataset consists of images of only the fashion items, against a consistent background.

- The images are all coloured. (Will have 3 dimensions when converted to tensors).

- Each image has a dimension of 300*400 pixels, but will be scaled down to 90*120.

- There are approximately 16,000 images in total.

- The images are split into 3 main categories: Glasses and Sunglasses, Trousers and Jeans, and Shoes.

- Every category has additional subclasses based on gender and product type:
	Glasses and Sunglasses (2): 'optical glasses', 'sunglasses'.
	Trousers and Jeans (4): 'Trousers Male', 'Jeans Male', 'Trousers Female', 'Jeans Female'.
	Shoes (11): 'Boots  Male', 'Trainers/Sneakers Male', 'Sandals/Flip flops/Slippers Male', 'Formal Shoes Male', 'Others Male'.
		    'Boots Female', 'Trainers/Sneakers Female', 'Ballerina shoes Female', 'High heels Female', 'Sandals/Flip flops/Slippers Female', 'Others Female'.


*** The objective is to return all labels associated with a given image i.e its main category and its respective sub-category.


- Because this is not a simple or linear dataset, to fully account for all the categories and sub-categories, one network might not be enough to achieve the objective.
  A network would be used to split the dataset into the three main categories, and more networks may be built to further split the data in each of the categories based on the gender and type.
