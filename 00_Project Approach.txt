THE STEPS TO BE TAKEN TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM:

- The problem we have here is a classification problem, and Convoluted Neural Networks (CNN) would be used to solve it.
  CNNs are a subtype of deep learning neural networks that have at least a convolutional layer.
  CNNs are ideal for this problem because because they are specialized in inferring information from data that ahas some spatial structure and correlation, i.e images.


PROCEDURE:

- First we'll build a primary model to classify all the images into one of the 3 main categories.
  
- Once this is done, we'll build models to further classify the images in each category into their sub-categories using one of two approaches:
	1. the approach of building a model to perform the classification into all the sub categories at once
	2. building multiple models to perform smaller classification tasks and stack these models hierachically with the output of one being fed as input into another.
	   For our case, the options we have are:
		- split the category into different genders then classify each gender split into the different types, or 
		- split it into the different types then classify each type by gender


APPROACH TAKEN FOR EACH CATEGORY:
- Glasses and Sunglasses (2):  Approach 1 - Because this has only two sub-categories, the classification into sub-categories can be easily done at once.
- Trousers and Jeans (4):  Approach 2     - This has 4 sub-categories. There 3 models would be built here in total.
				  	  - Trousers_and_Jeans_Gender_Split model: to perform the initial split of this category based on gender only.
					  - Trousers_and_Jeans_Type_Male model: to split the products for male gender into the types trousers or jeans.
					  - Trousers_and_Jeans_Type_Female model: to split the products for female gender into the types trousers or jeans. 
										  This model will employ regularization to improve its performance.
- Shoes (11):  Approach 1. 	- This has 11 sub-categories. Data augmentation will be applied to artificially create more samples for our data. 
				- The dropout technique for improving model performance will be employed here.
